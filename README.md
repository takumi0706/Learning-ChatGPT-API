## Installation

To use this project, you need to have Java installed on your system. Clone the repository and import it into your preferred Java IDE.

```
git clone https://github.com/takumi0706/Learning-ChatGPT-API.git
```

## Usage

To use the ChatGPT integration in your Java project:

1. Set up your OpenAI API key (see [Configuration](#configuration) section).
2. Call the `chatGPT` method with your desired prompt:

```java
String response = Main.chatGPT("Your prompt here");
System.out.println(response);
```

## Configuration

Before using the ChatGPT integration, you need to set up your OpenAI API key:

1. Sign up for an OpenAI account and obtain an API key.
2. Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` in the `Main.java` file with your actual API key:

```java
String apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
```

**Note:** It's recommended to use environment variables or a configuration file to store sensitive information like API keys, rather than hardcoding them in the source code.

## API Reference

The main method for interacting with the ChatGPT API is:

```java
public static String chatGPT(String prompt)
```

This method takes a prompt as input and returns the generated response from the ChatGPT model.

## Examples

Here's an example of how to use the ChatGPT integration:

```java
String prompt = "Tell me a joke about programming";
String response = Main.chatGPT(prompt);
System.out.println(response);
```
